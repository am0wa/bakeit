Welcome to BakeIT Guildelines 💜   
An introduction to the root concepts you would use on a daily basis will be given to you 👽

:::tip[“The hottest new programming language is English”]
– Andrej Karpathy
:::

* Writing a good **product** requires thinking about what your **users** are trying to do 💡
* Baking a delicious cake requires **time**, **patience**, the **right ingredients** and the **right steps** 🥮
* Quality of your **input** dictates your **output** and eventually **outcome** 🎩
* U are the **partner** of the company, **not slave** 🤝
* The **more choices** the longer it takes to decide which one is the best 🤔

## Cross-Pollination of Knowledge

In Nature, cross-pollination is when one plant pollinates a plant of another variety. The genetic material of both plants merge and the seeds that are produced include characteristics from both flowers 🐝

:::tip[The metaphor of cross-pollination]
Sharing and interchanging of ideas, thoughts, information, and knowledge for the enrichment of team & individual capabilities 🌻
:::

## Hick's Law

:::tip[The fewer the easier to pick]
"The more options available to a person, the longer it will take to decide which option is best"
:::

```
RT = a + b log2 (n)
// RT - response time
// a - time not involved with decision making
// b - time of cognitive processing
// n - number of alternatives
```

* **Start simple** add complexity later
* **Break down** complex processes into more **simple steps**
* **Reduce the options** for time-critical tasks
* **Highlight** recommended options

## Dunbar's Number

Robin Dunbar concluded that the size, relative to the body, of the neocortex – 
the part of the brain associated with cognition and language – is linked to the size of a cohesive social group. 
This ratio limits how much complexity a social system can handle.

:::note[The theory of Dunbar’s number]
We can only really maintain about **150 meaningful connections** at once
:::

The theory of Dunbar’s number holds that the tightest circle has just five people:

* `5` – loved ones
* `15` – good friends 
* `50` – friends 
* `150` – meaningful contacts 
* `500` – acquaintances 
* `1500` – people you can recognise 

People migrate in and out of these layers, but the idea is that space has to be carved out for any new entrants 🛂

To overcome this limitation and maintain the level of effectiveness we need the common ground – the purpose of BakeIT and 
[Am0wA Manifesto](http://localhost:4322/learn/am0wa-manifesto/)

## The Mountain Peak

:::tip[“We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do”]
– Steve Jobs
:::

* **Share the vision,** "Do you see that Mountain Peak? Now, go climb it..." 🏔️
* **Delegate desirable outcome** rather than **task** directive
* **Empower and trust** rather than control with incompetent limitations

## The Open Door

The most effective communication is face to face conversation.  
The simplest thing of all isn't really even about holding the door for someone else, it's just never letting it close in the first place 🎟️

## The Peter Principle

:::tip[Why things often go wrong]
"In organisation, each person rises to the level of his own incompetence"
– Lourence J. Peter
:::

This leads to Peter's corollary: 
"In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties"

So, now you know, therefore will not be so frustrated anymore 🤪 

## The Ladder of Replacement

:::tip[Changes go from the bottom Up]
"Why do U want to hire new CEO if U even do not have Executive admin?" 🤔
:::

So, if U want to **grow** (and stuck on the lvl of ur incompetence. LOL) – U have to **coach** your **replacement** 🪜

* **Grow from bottom Up** otherwise the Upper lvl would not have input and become Lazily inefficient 🌿
* **Infrastructure first** if u want to develop agriculture u need to build farms 🧑‍🌾 

## The Root Cause

:::tip[Don't optimize something that should not exist]
"Well, I do think there’s a good framework for thinking. It is **physics**.   
You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are — what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy"
– Elon Musk
:::


## The Chain of Command

Build your **own chain** of command.
This helps to build a strong culture where it’s easy to communicate and information flows **freely** 
supporting employees at all levels rather than strictly govern them 🧑‍🚀

```
...
ResearchAndFeedback.getConsumer() // Product owner 
POVision.getConsumer()            // UIX desiner
PORequirements.getConsumers() // [UIX Designer, Software engineer, QA Automation] 
UIDesign.getConsumer()            // Software engineer
NewFeature.getConsumer()          // QA Automation
// ...                               Development/Delivery manager ...
ReleasedApp.getConsumer()         // End User
```

**Note:** The scheme is reduced to development team for simplicity of understanding.     
Important chains as Shareholders, Executive Leadership, Operation, Marketing, Sales are implicitly hidden under `...` notation 🕵️
