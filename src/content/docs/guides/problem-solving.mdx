> <cite>— Albert Einstein</cite>

There's **no silver bullet**, yet here is my **personal bullet-list**:

* **Do the Right things** – then do things right 🎯
* **Upstream thinking** – proactive mindset, lasting impact 📈
* **Root Cause** – look beyond, dig down to the fundamental truth 🌰
* **Long-term ownership** – see the mountain top first, then go 🗻
* **Low-hanging fruit** – the simplest solution with the highest value 🍐
* **Explore first, judge letter** – thinking out loud out of box gives air 🪽
* **Embrace change due to fast feedback** – single change at the time reduces false beliefs 🏹
* **Visibility & transparency** – communicate clear solutions, show roadmap progress 👓🐾

Successful problem solving is Finding the **right solution** to the **right problem**

## First Principles thinking

> “When you struggle with a problem, that’s when you understand it”
> <cite>— Elon Musk</cite>

1. **Define the Problem clearly** – find the **core question**
2. **Break it down** – decompose into the elementary parts that're undeniably true
3. **Rebuild from the ground up** – reconstruct the solution from found fundamental truths
4. **Question first** – avoid automating/optimizing wrong thing before understanding root cause
5. **Simplify & focus** – strip away unnecessary complexity, focus on the essentials

:::tip[Scientists don’t assume anything. What are we absolutely sure is true?]
Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy
:::

Now, Let's boil it down to the **First Principles** thinking:

```

  motorboat: [🛶,🎿,⛽,🌊]
  tank️: [⚙️,🛡,🔫️,💣️]
  submarine: [🛳,️🐋,🔭,🌊]
  bicycle: [🚶,🛞,🪑‍,🔁️,🛣]
  snowmobile: [🛵,🎿,⏱️,❄️]
}
```

:::note[The best solution is not where everyone is already looking]
Boiling things down, then substituting a more effective solution for one of key parts brings innovation.
Combination of ideas from seemingly unrelated fields.

## Fast Decisions making

:::danger[Tasks saturation]
More tasks than U can handle leads to **stress**, **decision fatigue** and **burnout** 😰
:::

The key is to **make decisions quickly** and **adapt as U learn**:

* **Avoid analysis paralysis** – don't get stuck in overthinking, ditch ideological purity 🙉
* **Accept & Prioritize** – reduce the number of tasks to `N < 5` [(Miller's Law)](../../learn/quick-start/#millers-law) 🧮️
* **Next single task** – focus on the most important single task 🎯
* **One thing at a time** – change one thing, so U could analyze and learn 🩻
* **Make First step** – take the smallest action, to build momentum 🚶
* **Day One** – start all-over, like it's the first day of Ur project 🗓️
* **Minimal Viable Work** – focus on the smallest set of features that deliver value 🛠️

<Card title="CIA method" icon="emoji:detective">
  * **C**hoose a solution
  * **I**mplement it
  * **A**djust based on feedback

  Act instantly, then iterate based on new information

### <h3 class="hidden">5 WHYs</h3>
<Card title="5 WHYs" icon="emoji:red-question-mark">
  Repeatedly ask "Why?" (~five times)
  U can move beyond the immediate symptoms and uncover the foundational issue
