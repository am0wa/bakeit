### UX Design Principles

* **User-centered design** – focus on the **needs of end user** 👖
* **Usability** – make sure the product is **easy to use** and understand 🪛
* **Consistency** – maintain **familiarity** in elements look & functionality **across the product** 🧬
* **Accessibility** – design for **wide range** of users, including ones with disabilities 👂

_"UX principles are about both visual design and functionality.<br/>
E.g. a car engineer has to [understand](/guides/psychology/) how car is used, and how its look could [enhance](/guides/engineering/) its specs"_
