## UX Design Principles

* **User-centered design** – focus on the **needs of end user** 👖
* **Usability** – make sure the product is **easy to use** and understand 🪛
* **Consistency** – maintain **familiarity** in elements look & functionality **across the product** 🧬
* **Accessibility** – design for **wide range** of users, including ones with disabilities 👂
* **Visual hierarchy** – guide attention to the **most important** elements 🪜
* **User control** – give users a **sense of control** over their experience (right amount) ☸️

### <h3 class="hidden">Usability principles</h3>
<Card title="Usability principles" icon="emoji:screwdriver">
  * **Learnability** – how easy is to accomplish the task the first time use 🧠
  * **Efficiency** – does it allow to complete the desired task quickly and efficiently 🎯
  * **Memorability** – how easy to recognize how to use it again after a while 🤔
  * **Errors prevention** – how does it help users avoid making errors 🧯
