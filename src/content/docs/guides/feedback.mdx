:::tip[Praise in public, criticize in private]
**Feedback** aimed at achieving a **positive outcome** by providing someone with clear details that are useful for work & future
:::

* **Feedback sandwich** your critique between two positives 🍔
* **Details, not personality** – focus on specifics (data/actions/items, etc.), not the person 🎯
* **Facts, not assumptions** – objectively justify with facts, do not judge on assumptions 📈
* **Offer solutions, not blame** – suggest improvements instead of blame and directives 🛠
* **Control the tone** – deliver the informa️tion in a calm and respectful manner 📢

:::tip[12-minute break before responding]
To overcome the **reactive emotional response**, take a **12-minute break**.

:::caution[Negative attracts even more negative]
"Conversation **started on a negative note**, usually brings more such comments & often **ends on a negative note too**"
– Am0wA
:::

* **Be Specific** – highlight, what exactly was bad?

## Choose the Right Words

:::tip[The feeling]
"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget **how you made them feel**"
– Maya Angelou
:::

* **Absolutes**: Steer clear of `always` or `never`, `nothing` or `everything` –
feels **dismissive**
* **Absolute Certainty**: Avoid `I'm sure` – feels **dismissive** (try `Probably`)
* **False Ownership**: Avoid acts on behalf of `U` - feels like **blame** (try `I` instead)
* **Vagueness**: Avoid `kind of` or `sort of` – feels **vague**
* **Forcing**: Avoid `U should` or `U need` – feels **forced** (try `Could U?`)

:::note[Facts are not assumptions]
"Accusations based on **assumptions framed as facts** made on behalf of others, are **destructive** and lead to **resentful outcomes**"
– Am0wA
