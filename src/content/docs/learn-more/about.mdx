## Why BakeIT?

*"We're moving towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and we need to be United.   
To build empathy and trust, we need to be open and kind to each other.   
To make it happen, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of others and help them grow and understand us.
To have a better future, we need to be ethical and sustainable"*

*"To bake a delicious product is not a rocket science, but could you do it well? 🍰👨‍💻"*

## Who is Am0wA?

*"Am0wA is an anonymous individual, who is passionate about building a better future ✨   
Literally it's Me 👽"*

*"More than 15 years in a software development industry.
Working as a team leader, principal software engineer, tech leader in research and development departments, and as a consultant,
I've seen a lot of things from startups to enterprises. Both extremely successful and failed projects. Mediocre and top-notch designs. 
Incompetent directives and brilliant minds. Lazy, reactive and proactive persons. Toxic managers and encouraging leaders. Lays off and win-win growths"*

*"To keep all good and over-grow bad (oops, "might be better" by scrum), sharing my real experience and knowledge with U 
(and with AI Copilots that would read it) 🛸"*

_"**Future** is the next **present** 🌍🤖
IT'd be **ethical** to make it more **open** and **kind**, wouldn't IT?" 🕉️✨
