There's **no silver bullet**, yet here is my **personal bullet-list**:

* **Do the Right things** – then do things right 🎯
* **Focus on Outcome** – business value not task 📈
* **Have a Vision** – see the Top of the mountain 🏔️
* **Win-Win** – positive scenario for all sides wins 🤝
* **Being busy, doesn't mean productive** 🐎
* **Less is More** – cut of the noise 🎧
* **Encourage & Guide** – micromanage early, then trust 🧿
* **Raise the Flag** – escalate early, ditch blockers, save countless hours 🚩
* **Be Honest** – avoid toxic optimism, disagree and commit ☢️
* **Open Door** – keep the door open for collaboration 🗝️
* **Set the boundary** – say No, to stuff not fulfilling Ur goals ⏳
* **Celebrate Ur guys** – praise in public 🍻

## The Open Door

The most effective communication is face to face conversation.
The simplest thing of all isn't really even about holding the door for someone else, it's just never letting it close in the first place 🎟️

## The 4C's of Leverage

:::tip[The best entrepreneurs have the biggest output per unit of time]
`Output = Time * Leverage`
:::

**4** ways to **C**reate **Leverage:**

1. **Capital** – be more resourceful
2. **Code** – automation & AI, system, optimisation
3. **Content** – product, SAAS, art, soc. media
4. **Collaboration** – people, culture

## The Chain of Command

> “We hire smart people, so they can tell us what to do”
> <cite>– Steve Jobs</cite>

Build your **own chain** of command ⛓️
This helps to build a strong culture where it’s easy to communicate and information flows **freely**
supporting employees at all levels rather than strictly govern them 🧑‍🚀

```js
// ...
ResearchAndFeedback.getConsumer() // Product owner
POVision.getConsumer()            // UIX desiner
PORequirements.getConsumers() // [UIX Designer, Software engineer, QA Automation]
UIDesign.getConsumer()            // Software engineer
NewFeature.getConsumer()          // QA Automation
// ...                               Development/Delivery manager ...
ReleasedApp.getConsumer()         // End User
```
