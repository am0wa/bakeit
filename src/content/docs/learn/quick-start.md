Welcome to BakeIT Guildelines 💜   
An introduction to the root concepts U would use on a daily basis will be given to U 👽

> “The hottest new programming language is English” 
> <cite>– Andrej Karpathy</cite>

* Writing a **good product** requires thinking about what Ur **users** are trying to do 💡
* Baking a delicious cake requires **time**, **patience**, the **right ingredients** and the **right steps** 🥮
* Quality of Ur **input** dictates Ur **output** and eventually **outcome** 🎩
* U are the **partner** of the company, **not slave** 🤝
* The **more choices** the **longer it takes** to decide which one is the best 🤔

> “It’s not the hours you put in your work that counts, it’s the work you put in the hours”
> <cite>– Sam Ewing</cite>

## Hick's Law

:::tip[The fewer the easier to pick]
"The more options available to a person, the longer it will take to decide which option is best"
:::

```
RT = a + b log2 (n)
// RT - response time
// a - time not involved with decision making
// b - time of cognitive processing
// n - number of alternatives
```

* **Start simple** add complexity later
* **Break down** complex processes into more **simple steps**
* **Reduce the options** for time-critical tasks
* **Highlight** recommended options

## Pareto Principle

:::tip[80/20 rule - focus on "vital few"]
"Roughly **80%** of consequences come out from **20%** of causes (**vital few**)"
:::

* **20%** of Ur **actions** will likely drive **80%** of Ur **results**
* **20%** of Ur **tasks** will likely produce **80%** of **value**
* **20%** of Ur **customers** will likely lead to **80%** of Ur **sales**
* **20%** of Ur **products** will likely make **80%** of Ur **profits**

## Miller’s Law

:::tip[~7 items in working memory]
"The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory"
:::

* **Chunking** – brake down information into smaller, more manageable parts
* **Batching** – group similar tasks together
* **Prioritizing** – focus on the most important tasks first

Any element or action that isn’t helping users achieve their goal is working against them 🎯

## Eating The Frog

> "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first"
> <cite>– Mark Twain</cite>

* **Identify** the most impactful and challenging task 🐸
* **Do it first** before other todos 👽
* **Sense of accomplishment** will give U the energy to tackle the rest of the day ☀️

Completing your most difficult task early boosts productivity and motivation

## Cross-Pollination of Knowledge

:::tip[The metaphor of cross-pollination]
Sharing and interchanging of ideas, thoughts, information, and knowledge for the enrichment of team & individual capabilities 🌻
:::

In Nature, cross-pollination is when one plant pollinates a plant of another variety. The genetic material of both plants merge and the seeds that are produced include characteristics from both flowers 🐝

## The Mountain Peak

> “We hire smart people, so they can tell us what to do”
> <cite>– Steve Jobs</cite>

* **Share the vision,** "Do you see that Mountain Peak? Now, go climb it..." 🏔️
* **Delegate desirable outcome** rather than **task** directive
* **Empower and trust** rather than control with incompetent limitations

## The Root Cause

:::tip[Don't optimize something that should not exist]
_"Well, I do think there’s a good framework for thinking. It is **physics**.
You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are — what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy"  
– Elon Musk_
:::

## The Peter Principle

> "In organisation, each person rises to the level of his own incompetence"  
> <cite>– Lourence J. Peter</cite>

This leads to Peter's corollary: 
_"In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties"_

So, now you know, therefore will not be so frustrated anymore 🤪 

## The Ladder of Replacement

:::tip[Changes go from the bottom Up]
Why do U want to hire new CEO if U even do not have Executive admin? 🤔
:::

So, if U want to **grow** (and stuck on the lvl of ur incompetence. LOL) – U have to **coach** Ur **replacement** 🪜

* **Grow from bottom Up** otherwise the Upper lvl would not have input and become Lazily inefficient 🌿
* **Infrastructure first** if U want to develop agriculture U need to build farms 🧑‍🌾

## Dunbar's Number

Robin Dunbar concluded that the size, relative to the body, of the neocortex –
the part of the brain associated with cognition and language – is linked to the size of a cohesive social group.
This ratio limits how much complexity a social system can handle.

:::note[The theory of Dunbar’s number]
We can only really maintain about **150 meaningful connections** at once
:::

The theory of Dunbar’s number holds that the tightest circle has just five people:

* `5` – loved ones
* `15` – good friends
* `50` – friends
* `150` – meaningful contacts
* `500` – acquaintances
* `1500` – people you can recognise

People migrate in and out of these layers, but the idea is that space has to be carved out for any new entrants 🛂

To overcome this limitation and maintain the level of effectiveness we need the common ground – the purpose of BakeIT and
