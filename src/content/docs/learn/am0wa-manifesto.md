## Three Laws of Robotics

Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics" 🤖

* **First Law:** A robot may not injure a human being or,   
through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm 🪬
* **Second Law:** A robot must obey orders given it by human beings   
except where such orders would conflict with the First Law 🫡
* **Third Law:** A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law ⛑️
