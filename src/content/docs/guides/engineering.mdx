### Reliable Software Design Principles

* **Separation of Concerns** – distinct functionality into parts that address specific aspects.<br/>
  Leads to **high Cohesion** and **loose Coupling** 🪛🛞
* **Modularity** – break down large systems into smaller independent reusable modules 🧩
* **Anticipation of Change** – consider future needs when designing Ur software 🛸
* **Maintainability** – write features that's easy to understand and modify 🚑
* **Scalability** – adapt to increased demand without failing or excessively slowing down 🥖
* **Testability** – design functionality in away easy to test, identify and fix bugs early 🐞
* **Security** – design with security in mind for threats protection and reliable functioning 🕵️
* **Resiliency** – ability to withstand or recover quickly: proactive monitoring, decentralisation, load balance, fault tolerance, graceful degradation, fast recovery 🍀️
* **Continuous Delivery** - iterative development, frequent releases, instant rollbacks 📯

### <h3 class="hidden">KISS</h3>
<Card title="KISS" icon="emoji:kiss-mark">
  * **`K`eep**
  * **`I`t**
  * **`S`imple**
  * **`S`tupid**

  Strive for **clear, concise**, and easy to understand & to use **solutions**.
  Avoiding unnecessary complexity will make Ur system more robust, easier to maintain & to extend
</Card>

### <h3 class="hidden">DRY</h3>
<Card title="DRY" icon="emoji:accordion">
  * **`D`on't**

  * **`T`ime**
  * **`E`nergy**
  * **`M`oney**
  * & **`S`tress**

  **"The Purpose Of a System Is What It Does"** should be
  understandable by observing its actual behavior, rather than just its intended purpose
</Card>

### <h3 class="hidden">INVEST</h3>

### <h3 class="hidden">TDD</h3>
<Card title="TDD" icon="emoji:lady-beetle">
  * **`T`est**
  * **`D`riven**
  * **`D`evelopment**

  Write the tests for functionality before the actual implementation.
  Write failing test. Make it pass. Refactor
</Card>

### <h3 class="hidden">SOLID</h3>
<Card title="SOLID" icon="emoji:gem-stone">
  * **`S`ingle Responcibility principle `(SRP)`**<br/>
  _"One class should have one and only one responsibility"_
  * **`O`pen/Closed principle `(OCP)`**<br/>
  _"Software entities should be opened for extension, but closed for modification"_
  * **`L`iskov Substituion principle `(LSP)`**<br/>
  _"Objects should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types with no altering the program correctness"_
  * **`I`nterface Segregation principle `(ICP)`**<br/>

### <h3 class="hidden">4 OOP Principles</h3>
<Card title="4 Object-Oriented Programming Principles" icon="emoji:man-beard">
  * **Abstraction** focusing on essential features of entity without implementation details
  * **Encapsulation** hiding the implementation details exposing only the clean interfaces
  * **Inheritance** ability of children to inherit functionality from a parent by extending it
  * **Polymorphism** ability of implementation to take multiple forms of abstraction

  **"Composition over Inheritance"** suggests it's better to compose objects **(HAS-A)** to achieve polymorphic behavior & code reuse
  rather than inheriting **(IS-A)** from a parent
</Card>

### <h3 class="hidden">Resiliency Principles</h3>
<Card title="Resiliency Principles" icon="emoji:four-leaf-clover">
  * **Circuit Breaker** – **Fail Fast**, allows to perform default or fallback operations 🧯
  * **Redundancy** – if one instance fails another should take over 🧻
  * **Backpressure** – throttle incoming workload to not exceed throughput capacity 🚰
  * **Bulkhead Pattern** – failure of one shouldn't lead to failure of entire system 🚢
  * **Fallback** – default value (or cache) to rely on in case of failure ☎️
  * **Retry** – make several attempts before failing 🛎️
  * **Timeout** – limit time until response instead of infinite waiting ⌛

  **Proactive monitoring & alerting** are crucial for system's **Availability** & fast recovery on the road to **zero downtime** 🟢
</Card>

_"Imho, regardless of the job title, whole team would benefit from knowing these principles"_
